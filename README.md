## Setup

You will have to setup Spotify API tokens as `SPOTIFY_ID` and `SPOTIFY_SECRET` environment variables in the imported workflow. You can obtain these tokens from [this site](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

The default action is to play the track, album, artist or playlist on the Mac Spotify client.
